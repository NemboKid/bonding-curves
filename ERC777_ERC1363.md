# ERC777

- ERC777 introduces hooks (`tokensToSend` and `tokensReceived`) to notify contracts about incoming and outgoing tokens, reducing the risk of token loss in contracts not designed to handle them.
- You can send data with transfers (`send()`), so you can be more creative when creating protocols (similar to ERC721)
- A big drawback lies within the hooks, which are nice and can be very powerful, but they come to the cost of security and there have been many reentrancy attacks with these hooks.

# ERC1363

- hooks that can execute after `transfer`, `transferFrom` or `approve`
- for example if you call `transferAndCall`, the callback `onTransferReceived` will get called in which the `ERC1363Receiver` can do something. So first you can transfer a token, and then automatically there can be another function call without sending an extra transaction and spend gas.
